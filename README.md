<strong> Introduction </strong>
<br>
The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen eating food pellets. As the snake eats, it grows longer, making it increasingly difficult to avoid collisions with itself or the walls. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
